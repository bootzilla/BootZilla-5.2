NOTE: Read this document entirely, before using BootZilla.

Benefits of v5.2 over v5.1:

*Updated Tools 
	-> New locations for files, since bhtproject is no more.

*Improved BootCD functionality -> 
	Updated with all the latest bootable utilities
	All Image creation/Cd burning is done with ImgBurn!
	
*Minor improvements in build and update scripts
	-> Properly converts v4.2.6 into v5.2!

	
Quick-Start: Run BZUpdate.cmd to get BootZilla updated, or built. 

PROTIP: READ THE TEXT! Follow the prompts.

What is BootZilla? 
BootZilla is a handpicked set of tools that can help  any computer user or tech
in removing and cleaning up after malware infections.

How do I build BootZilla?

To build a full updated package, double-click the BZUpdate file in the root 
BootZilla directory, and type in option 1 at the prompt.

Allow up to 30 minutes for the full build process to finish. 
The total download should be no more than 125MB total.

To update, double-click the BZUpdate file in the root BootZilla directory, and 
type in option 2 at the prompt. Wait about 5 minutes (broadband), and the updates 
will be downloaded. 

For a boot CD,  double-click the BZUpdate file in the root BootZilla directory, and 
type in option 4, wait between 5-15 minutes for the build process to complete. Once 
the build process is complete, a program will prompt you to insert a blank CD, so that 
BootZilla can be burned. Wait about 2-5 minutes, depending on your burner speed, and 
you'll end up with a fully bootable BootZilla CD.

But... I want a Bootable BootZilla CD with MemTest and the Windows XP Recovery Console!
See the above instructions for Creation of a CD.


If you find BootZilla to be very useful, why not donate a cent or two to benefit the author ;)
